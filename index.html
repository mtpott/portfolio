            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>After graduating from Davidson College in 2019 with a degree in Art History, I worked for the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA in Development Events. Due to COVID-19, I moved back home to North Carolina, where I began working at a coffee shop as a barista. I picked up coding as a hobby, and dipped my feet into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After tinkering around for a few months, I realized I had a deeper interest in software development and signed up for UNC Charlotteâ€™s Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>
              <p>In my free time, I enjoy cycling classes, live music, yoga, running, hiking, traveling, and reading. I am currently reading <em>The Witcher</em> series and <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em> by Haruki Murakami. I also enjoy horror movies and reality TV! Please find my contact information below. I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
